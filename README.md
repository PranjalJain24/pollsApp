# pollsApp

In this project we have made simple polls app. Itâ€™ll create two models: Question and Choice. A Question has a question and a publication date. List of the questions is displayed. A Choice has two fields: the text of the choice and a vote tally. Each Choice is associated with a Question. This project will help you understand the basics of Django.
