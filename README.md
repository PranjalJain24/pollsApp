# pollsApp

In this project we have made simple polls app. Itâ€™ll create two models: Question and Choice. A Question has a question and a publication date. List of the questions is displayed. A Choice has two fields: the text of the choice and a vote tally. Each Choice is associated with a Question. This project will help you understand the basics of Django.

### Setup and Installations:

#### To know the commands for these processes refer to the repository: [https://github.com/PranjalJain24/DjangoArchitecture]
* Setup virtual Environment for the project.
* Activate the virtual environment.
* Clone the repository using:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/PranjalJain24/pollsApp  
```
If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than pollsApp, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/PranjalJain24/pollsApp/edit/master/README.md mynewgit
```
That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called mynewgit.
  
* Install Django related requirements and dependencies using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Make migrations for Database.

* You can add new Questions and Choices using Admin portal or using below commands in cmd terminal:
```
python manage.py shell
>>> from polls.models import Choice, Question  # Import the model classes we just wrote.

# To display all the Questions in the system:
>>> Question.objects.all()

# Create a new Question.
>>> from django.utils import timezone
>>> q = Question(question_text="Is this my third Question?", pub_date=timezone.now())

# Save the object into the database. You have to call save() explicitly.
>>> q.save()

#Set choices for question having id=3: 
>>> q = Question.objects.get(pk=3)

# Display any choices from the related object set -- none so far.
>>> q.choice_set.all()
<QuerySet []>

# Create two choices.
